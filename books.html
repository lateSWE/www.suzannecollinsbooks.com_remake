                            Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.
                            And what scares her more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.
                            As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel
                            Victory Tour,
                            the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt,
                            that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.

                            Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest
                            district of Panem, the remains of what used be North America.
                            Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender
                            terms,
                            each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event
                            called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules,
                            and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed.
                            When her sister is chosen by lottery, Katniss steps up to go in her place.
