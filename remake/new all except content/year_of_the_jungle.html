                            "In this picture book, Collins sensitively examines the impact of war on the very young,
                            using
                            her own family history as a template. Suzy is the youngest of four children—Proimos draws
                            her
                            with impossibly big, questioning blue eyes and a mass of frizzy red hair—and she is
                            struggling
                            to understand the changes in her family. "My dad has to go to something called a war," she
                            explains. "It's in a place called Viet Nam. Where is Viet Nam? He will be gone a year. How
                            long
                            is a year? I don't know what anybody's talking about." When Suzy learns that her father is
                            in
                            the jungle, she imagines something akin to the setting of her favorite cartoon (Collins
                            suggests
                            it's George of the Jungle). As the months wear on, though, Suzy begins to piece together the
                            danger her father is in, whether it's through the increasingly unnerving postcards he sends
                            (one
                            reads, "Pray for me," in closing) or by catching a snippet of wartime violence on the news.
                            "Explosions. Helicopters. Guns. Soldiers lie on the ground. Some of them aren't moving." In
                            four
                            wordless spreads, Proimos makes Suzy's awakening powerfully clear, as the gray jungle she
                            initially pictured (populated by four smiling, brightly colored animals) gives way to a more
                            violent vision, as the animals morph into weapons of war. Just when Suzy's confusion and
                            fear
                            reach an apex: "Then suddenly my dad's home." As in Collins's Hunger Games books, the fuzzy
                            relationship between fear and bravery, and the reality of combat versus an imagined (or, in
                            the
                            case of those books, manufactured) version of it is at the forefront of this story. By the
                            final
                            pages, Suzy has come to understand that "Some things have changed but some things will
                            always be
                            the same." It's a deceptively simple message of reassurance that readers who may currently
                            be in
                            Suzy's situation can take to heart, whether their loved ones return changed, as hers did, or
                            don't return at all. Ages 4–up."

                            "Suzanne Collins, author of the famously bloody "Hunger Games" trilogy, has written a
                            picture-book memoir about what life at home is like for a child whose father has gone away
                            to
                            war. Collins's own father went to Vietnam the year she turned 6, and she's said the
                            experience
                            had a profound effect on him. But though post-traumatic stress disorder is often spoken of
                            these
                            days, the more subtle effects of war on the children of men and women serving abroad are
                            less
                            well known. "Year of the Jungle" is narrated by a little red-haired girl named Sue, whose
                            father
                            reads her poems by Ogden Nash. Her favorite is about a dragon named Custard that "keeps
                            crying
                            for a nice safe cage." Sue thinks that while Custard "always feels afraid, he is really the
                            bravest of all. And that's what makes him special." When her father leaves for Vietnam, Sue
                            must
                            follow Custard's example. The year "goes on and on." Sue waits. She measures the passing of
                            time
                            by the arrival of a turkey, a Christmas tree, shamrocks and colored eggs. There is a
                            postcard
                            with a picture of Saigon, then one with a picture of a Vietnamese fisherman. The children
                            watch
                            their mother, worried she might be "going to the jungle, too," but she stays. Sue's initial
                            impression of the jungle is positive. Her "favorite cartoon character lives in a jungle,"
                            and
                            she thinks she'd like to go to Vietnam to find her father. She will fly there. "You can fly
                            anywhere in your dreams." But over the course of the year, the dream begins to darken. The
                            postcards stop coming. Then Sue's father sends her a birthday card when it isn't her
                            birthday,
                            and she begins to realize that "the jungle must be a very confusing place" for her father to
                            have made "such a serious mistake." One day, she watches graphic footage of the war on
                            television, and her mother rushes in to turn off the set. Sue is afraid, but she doesn't
                            have
                            the language to describe her fear. She hides in the closet to cry alone. While Sue is not
                            able
                            to formulate her feelings in words, James Proimos's excellent illustrations capture her
                            confusion. In one image, Sue imagines the landscape of Vietnam as a place with green
                            elephants
                            shooting white blobby monsters from their trunks and yellow goblins rising from coffee cups,
                            while a rhino-shaped helicopter floats overhead. This visual nightmare mirrors a child's
                            skewed
                            perception of war so well that it is clear Sue is going through her own version of hell. At
                            the
                            end of the year, Sue's father returns, "tired and thin," his skin "the color of pancake
                            syrup."
                            He "stares into space. He is here but not here." "Some things have changed," Sue reflects,
                            "but
                            some things will always be the same." In other words, bad things happen, but life goes on.
                            "Year
                            of the Jungle" may take place in the late 1960s, but with more than 2.3 million Americans
                            deployed abroad between 2001 and 2012, the mixture of anxiety, excitement, fear, boredom and
                            confusion Sue experiences on the home front will be sadly familiar to many children. For
                            them,
                            Collins's picture book may be a good tool to discuss the complex feelings war brings into a
                            household. Children are sure to ask why Sue's father went away, and why he was different
                            when he
                            returned. Maybe some frank discussions about war, ones that involve more than stories about
                            courageous dragons, will help children better understand what military service entails.
                            "Year of
                            the Jungle" brings up big questions. Parents will need to provide the answers ."

                            "Suzanne Collins' autobiographical picture book, Year of the Jungle: Memories from the Home
                            Front, seems a sharp departure for the author of The Hunger Games, the best-selling
                            dystopian trilogy. But in a reassuring and deceptively simple way, Jungle, aimed at readers
                            4 and up, continues Collins' exploration of the effect of war and violence on kids. In
                            Hunger Games, for readers 12 and up, teens are forced to kill or be killed as part of
                            state-sponsored entertainment. In Collins' first fantasy series, the Underland Chronicles,
                            for readers 8 and up, two kids fall into an underground world on the brink of war. Jungle
                            (Scholastic), illustrated by James Proimos,is narrated by Suzy, a frizzy-haired, big-eyed
                            first grader whose dad is sent "to something called a war" in a "place called Viet Nam."
                            Suzy confesses, "I don't know what anybody's talking about." When she hears Vietnam is a
                            jungle, she thinks of a cartoon set in a jungle where elephants and apes pal around. Reality
                            intrudes when Suzy accidentally sees a TV news report from Vietnam with explosions, guns and
                            soldiers on the ground. "Some of them aren't moving," she reports. Her worst fears are
                            conveyed without words, just Proimos' paintings. Suzy's dad returns home, just as Collins'
                            own dad, an Air Force officer, did in 1968. Collins offers no moralizing on war, just a
                            vivid reminder of what it's like to be young and innocent in a world that's not. I can see a
                            lot of kids whose parents are in someplace called Afghanistan — or another confusing place —
                            identifying with Suzy."

                            "First-grader Suzy's father is in the jungles of Vietnam for a year. Through a tightly
                            controlled child's point of view, readers live the year with little Suzy in the sheltered
                            world her parents have built for her. She understands little at first, imagining romps in
                            the jungle with elephants and apes. Her father sends her postcards every so often with
                            cheery scenes of the tropics. Eventually, the postcards stop coming. She misses her dad,
                            especially when her brother takes over some of her father's duties, like reading the comics
                            or Ogden Nash's poems to her. One day, the wall of protection is broken by the television,
                            with frightening visions of explosions, helicopters, guns and dead soldiers. Her mother
                            whisks her away, too late. Proimos' ink-and-digital art, in his signature cartoon style,
                            adds needed humor to a frankly scary story that honors Suzy's experience and respects those
                            who share it. Occasional full-page wordless spreads allow readers to see into Suzy's mind,
                            beginning with her flying through the jungle and leading up to her post-epiphany anxiety
                            about tanks and helicopters and rifles. With a notable lack of patriotic rhetoric or clichés
                            about bravery and honor, Collins holds firm to her childhood memories, creating a universal
                            story for any child whose life is disrupted by war. Important and necessary. (Picture book.

                            "Collins mines her own experience to tell a tender, personal story of war seen through a
                            child's eyes. Firstgrader Suzy's father is deployed to Viet Nam. At first, though she misses
                            him, she dreams of the exotic jungle. But as the year goes on, marked by Christmas trees and
                            candy hearts, things get harder. His postcards arrive less and less frequently, while news
                            of the war, and its real dangers, comes more and more often. In the end Suzy's father
                            returns, and while some things are different, some things are the same. Collins' unflinching
                            g first-person account details the fears and disappointments of the situation as a child
                            would experience them. And where more realistic illustrations would feel overwrought and
                            sentimental, Proimos's flat, cartoony drawings, with their heavy lines and blocky shapes,
                            are sturdy and sweet, reflecting a child's clear-eyed innocence. While small, personal
                            details and specific references to Viet Nam fix the story in one child's individual
                            experience, it is these very particularities that establish the kind of indelible and
                            heartfelt resonance to be universally understood. Indeed, children missing parents in all
                            kinds of circumstances will find comfort here."

                            "This moving picture book recounts, through the author's eyes as a child, the year of her
                            father's military tour of duty in Viet Nam. The youngest of four kids growing up in a safe,
                            loving family, Suzy is first seen listening to her dad read Ogden Nash's poem about Custard,
                            the dragon who stays brave despite his inner fears. Thus the stage is set for her father's
                            imminent deployment. In this pre-Internet world, his postcards provide tenuous but tangible
                            connections as the first grader tries to comprehend what a jungle is, what her father is
                            doing there, and the passage of time ("Has it been a year yet?"). But Suzy's concerns
                            increase when Dad confuses her birthday with a sister's, and then the postcards cease. When
                            one abruptly surfaces, Dad signs it, "Pray for me." (She does, "very hard.") Television news
                            and a near-drowning incident during a swimming lesson feed the child's anxieties. Suddenly,
                            Dad is home, "tired and thin… his skin… the color of pancake syrup." Suzy struggles to
                            articulate her harbored fears, which he gently allays, and the two resume reading about
                            Custard, whose stoicism surely resonates more deeply for them. Vibrantly colored cartoon
                            illustrations, outlined in thick black ink, underscore a child's point of view. The
                            characters' enormous eyes and boldly colored pupils provide an arresting motif. Suzy's
                            increasingly haunted imaginings, depicted on spreads of painterly gray tones with bursts of
                            color, stand in stark visual contrast to the narrative text and illustrations framed by
                            generous white space. The author's spot-on memories paired with child-friendly art create a
                            universal exploration of war and its effect on young children, ideally shared with and
                            facilitated by a sensitive adult."

                            "Collins, well known for her middle-school and YA fantasies, offers here a radical change of
                            pace in this picture book story inspired by her own childhood, documenting the year young
                            Suzy's father goes off to the Vietnam War. At first, the prospect doesn't sound all that bad
                            to a rising first-grader with little grasp of time; how long could one year be?
                            Additionally, Dad is headed for the jungle, and some of Suzy's favorite animals live (at
                            least by her reckoning) in the jungle. A year turns out to be a very long time, though,
                            especially when postcards come only sporadically, people's efforts at cheering her up only
                            fill her with heretofore unconsidered anxieties, and Dad's brief missives seem increasingly
                            distanced and confused. Theirs is a happy-ish ending—Dad does come home, although "he looks
                            different. Tired and thin and his skin has turned the color of pancake syrup. . . . He
                            stares into space. He is here but not here." Collins' text is simple, but it's rich in the
                            telling details that establish the pervasive fear ("So many things are scary now") that
                            spills over into other aspects of the little girl's life—getting a birthday card from Dad
                            that should have gone to her sister, being showered with too much Halloween candy from a
                            sympathetic neighbor, having a terrifying experience of being tossed into a local swimming
                            pool. Proimos' ink-lined, digitally colored illustrations are the pitch-perfect tonal
                            complement to Collins' narration, with the family portrayed as wide-eyed, childlike cartoons
                            that carry on with daily life in crayon-bright hues, while young Suzy's angst-filled
                            imaginings take shape in full-spread, full-bleed gray-tone scenes that twist her innocent
                            favorite animals into recurrent nightmarish motifs and symbols of war. With text and
                            illustrations that invite close reading, this will be a powerful title to share with
                            children well beyond picture-book age. EB"

                            "Hunger Games trilogy author Suzanne Collins reverts to her years writing for youth
                            television programming like Scholastic Entertainment's Clifford's Puppy Days for Year of the
                            Jungle, her latest book release for her youngest audience yet. To her, it's the perfect age
                            for kids to begin digesting the complicated concept of war. Suzy, the protagonist in the
                            autobiographical picture book, is based on a 6-year-old Collins and her family during the
                            year her father was deployed in Vietnam. Suzy refers to it as Viet Nam and envisions it as
                            the "jungle," but what appears as a picturesque backdrop in children's cartoons soon morphs
                            into a terrifying place, especially as images of the first televised war creep into her
                            family's home. She begins to understand where her father is, and why exactly he asks her to
                            "Pray for me." For three years, Collins thumbed through postcards and gifts her father gave
                            her while he was overseas. "I felt like there was a story here, but every time I tried to
                            visualize the book, I drew a blank," says Collins. "My fear was, with the subject matter,
                            that the impulse would be to make the art dark and very serious." Seasoned illustrator and
                            close friend James Proimos captures childlike fascination and fear when transforming the
                            jungle from a home for friendly animals to a field for frightening war tools. The book also
                            reassures readers that despite any parent's absence, their love for their children will
                            never leave. "I hope people will read the book, even if they don't have a deployed family
                            member, even if they're not part of a military family," says Collins. "Maybe it will help
                            some kids understand what other kids might be going through if they have a parent deployed
                            overseas."

                            "YEAR OF THE JUNGLE is a moving, personal account of how it feels to have a parent off at
                            war when you're too young to understand what war means or how long a year is. Little Suzy is
                            confused and misses her dad terribly, delighting in his postcards and praying for his
                            return, and using her imagination to picture him in the jungle. She's also a regular, smiley
                            kid with a cat, two older siblings, and a friend she draws with. Collins deftly balances the
                            fear and freakout of a little girl who learns her dad's in danger with the upbeat,
                            optimistic portrayal of a kid going about the business of being a kid. James Proimos'
                            cartoony illustrations are more reassuring and funny than scary. But there's one imagined
                            war scene (with images of guns, tanks, airplanes, explosions), and he clearly expresses
                            Suzy's fear and worry when her eyes get very big, in one case filling nearly the whole
                            page."

                            "In the last book of the "Hunger Games" trilogy, author Suzanne Collins offered a bleak
                            vision of war that felt personal. Now we know the source. In "Year of the Jungle"
                            (Scholastic, $17.99, ages 4 and older), Collins writes a child's-eye memoir of life during
                            her father's tour in Vietnam (with illustrations by James Proimos). Soldiers who go to war
                            leave questions for families to live with -- Where are they? What are they experiencing? Are
                            they alive? -- and children are experts at filling in gaps. The little girl hears her father
                            is in the jungle, so she imagines the jungle she knows from cartoons. The illustrations show
                            how clues from the adult world feed her worries. She is a thinker, and when her father
                            arrives home, changed, she finds a way to reach him."

                            Proimos (Scholastic £10.99), is an unusual, brave autobiographical experiment from the
                            author of The Hunger Games. It is about the year Collins's father was deployed to Vietnam
                            when she was a child. It's not sensational but nor does it evade the emotional issues
                            involved. When "worried ladies" (presumably friends of her mother's) tried to reassure her
                            about her father – "your dad will be just fine" – and gave her extra sweets, it had the
                            unsurprising effect of making her suddenly worried. Proimos ingeniously uses jungle pictures
                            to illustrate her emotions. When her father returns: "He is here but not here." Not an
                            uncontroversial read yet not to be missed. (5+)."

                            "A masterful picture book excels at revealing a young child's experience during the year her
                            father is away at war. Suzy's dad has to go to a place called Viet Nam. She imagines flying
                            in the jungle—her favorite cartoon is set in a jungle—with her cat, Rascal. She is the
                            youngest in a family determined to shelter her from things she's not ready to understand.
                            But they can't protect her from good intentions. When she tells people her dad's in Viet
                            Nam, they get worried. At Halloween, "One of the worried ladies says, 'Your dad will be just
                            fine,' and gives me way too much extra candy. I start to feel worried, too." Over the year
                            there are many unsettling events. One of her dad's postcards says "Pray for me." He sends
                            her a birthday card in winter, but her birthday is in summer. She accidentally sees a news
                            report about Viet Nam. "Later I hide in the closet and cry." The postcards stop. Suzy's
                            flights of imagination become darker, tainted by fear she can't express. It's only when her
                            dad returns that she can finally speak that fear, if indirectly, when she tells him, "Rascal
                            didn't think you were coming back." Suzanne Collins mines her own childhood memories,
                            transforming them with tremendous skill into a story that is resonant and truthful and
                            timeless and remarkably child-centered. James Proimos's illustrations are stylistically
                            simple but wisely executed, full of sensitivity and power and poignancy, along with
                            occasional moments of whimsy (that cat!)."
