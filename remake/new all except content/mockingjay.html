                            "At its best the trilogy channels the political passion of "1984," the memorable violence of
                            "A Clockwork Orange," the imaginative ambience of "The Chronicles of Narnia" and the
                            detailed inventiveness of "Harry Potter." The specifics of the dystopian universe, and the
                            fabulous pacing of the complicated plot, give the books their strange, dark charisma."

                            "Collins does several things brilliantly, not the least of which is to provide
                            heart-stopping chapter endings that turn events on their heads and then twist them once
                            more. But more ambitious is the way she brings readers to questions and conclusions about
                            war throughout the story. There's nothing didactic here, and sometimes the rush of events
                            even obscures what message there is. Yet readers will instinctively understand what Katniss
                            knows in her soul, that war mixes all the slogans and justifications, the deceptions and
                            plans, the causes and ideals into an unsavory stew whose taste brings madness. That there is
                            still a human spirit that yearns for good is the book's primrose of hope."

                            "This dystopic-fantasy series, which began in 2008, has had such tremendous crossover appeal
                            that teens and parents may discover themselves vying for -- and talking about -- the family
                            copy of "Mockingjay." And there's much to talk about because this powerful novel pierces
                            cheery complacency like a Katniss-launched arrow. Look skeptically at computer and
                            television images, it suggests, be aware of spin, gaze upon the young faces of the world's
                            soldiers. Children forced to kill children? It's not just in the pages of a novel."

                            "But being the Mockingjay comes with a price as Katniss must come to terms with how much of
                            her own humanity and sanity she can willingly sacrifice for the cause, her friends, and her
                            family. Collins is absolutely ruthless in her depictions of war in all its cruelty,
                            violence, and loss, leaving readers, in turn, repulsed, shocked, grieving and, finally,
                            hopeful for the characters they've grown to empathize with and love. Mockingjay is a fitting
                            end to the series that began with The Hunger Games (2008) and Catching Fire (2009) and will
                            have the same lasting resonance as William Golding's Lord of the Flies and Stephen King's
                            The Stand."

                            "Mockingjay" is without question the most brutal of the trilogy. Nobody emerges unscathed –
                            very bad things happen to everyone from fan favorites down to characters so minor a reader
                            has to pause and think, "Now, who was that again?" before recoiling in horror at their fate.
                            Collins doesn't take war lightly – her characters debate the morality involved in tactics
                            used to try to overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those
                            tactics. It is also an entirely gripping read. In Katniss, Collins has crafted a heroine so
                            fierce and tenacious that this reader will follow her anywhere."

                            terrorist label. More maudlin than the first two books in the series, "Mockingjay" is also
                            the most violent and bloody and, based on the actions and statements of its characters, its
                            most overtly antiwar — though not so much that it distracts from a series conclusion that is

                            "Throughout the trilogy, Collins has asked readers to consider heavy questions. What level
                            of violence is justified to achieve needed change? How much integrity can one compromise for
                            a just end? To what extent does responsibility to others demand sacrifice of self? How much
                            control does anyone have over the construction of self? Katniss is the ideal vehicle for
                            this dialogue, her present-tense narration constantly putting her own motivations and even
                            identity under scrutiny.It's not giving away anything to reveal that Katniss will be tested
                            sorely, that allegiances will shift, that heart-thumping scenes of combat will yield to
                            anguished reflection, that she and readers will find themselves always wondering just whom
                            to trust, that she and readers will lose friends they love. In the final analysis, this is
                            exactly the book its fans have been hoping for. It will grab them and not let go, and if it
                            leaves them with questions, well, then, it's probably exactly the book Collins was hoping
                            for, too."
