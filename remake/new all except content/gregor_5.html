                            "Perhaps Collins's greatest achievement in these tales is the effortless introduction of
                            weighty geopolitical ethics into rip-roaring adventure. It seems as elusive in the Underland
                            as up above, but Gregor and his companions, including the unforgettable rat Ripred, may yet
                            find a way. The resolution is bittersweet but faintly hopefulâ€”a fitting end for an
                            unflinchingly gutsy series whose deftly drawn characters have always lived dangerously."

                            "Collins delivers more of what's made this series so compelling: vivid action scenes,
                            detailed military machinations, and nuanced character development. The plot moves swiftly
                            but with deliberation, reflecting the Regalian leaders' strategic chess-game approach to the
                            conflict. In the end, though the unimaginable doesn't happen, no one is without physical and
                            emotional scars. Readers, too, will be battle-weary but buoyed by Collins's ultimate message
                            of hope. As the Underlanders would say: fly you high, Gregor."

                            "Consistent quality has been a hallmark of this series. Although the story line has
                            gradually become darker, Gregor maintains his endearing qualities as a reluctant hero. His
                            love for his family and his compassion for his friends never flag. The world of Regalia,
                            located below the streets of New York City, presents a magical realm of possibilities for
                            young readers of this excellent acquisition for any library."

                            "A realistic conclusion, including the loss of old friends and a message about the
                            importance of peace and trust, leaves readers with a sense of optimism about the future of
                            the Underland. Friends and foes from the previous volumes reappear here, and Gregor's
                            self-doubts and changing relationship with Luxa add to his depth as a protagonist. Fans of
                            the series will find much to appreciate, from an enigmatic prophecy to the complex rat
                            Ripred, and they'll be drawn in by Collins's tight pacing and sense of urgency."

                            "The book is fast-paced, easy to read and contains plenty of battle scene and gore for young
                            readers. But it also deals with a boy suddenly forced to make major decisions and face the
                            true and terrible realism of war. The so-called "traitor rat," Ripred reappears and we learn
                            the story behind his decision to join the forces opposed to The Bane. I find Ripred to be
                            one of the most fascinating characters in the book.
                            Armchair Interviews says: Fans of the earlier four books will find plenty of enjoy with this
                            one.."
