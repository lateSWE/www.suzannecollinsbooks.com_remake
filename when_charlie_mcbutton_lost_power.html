                            "A clever, humorous story in rhyme. Charlie's techno-driven world comes to a crashing halt
                            when a thunderstorm causes a power outage. His mother advises, "You'll have to find
                            something without plugs to play./Read a book!/Clean your room!/Sing a song!/Model clay!"
                            Uninspired, Charlie finally remembers an old handheld video game, but the battery is
                            missing. Desperate, he steals one from his sister's talking doll and ends up in the time-out
                            chair. Feeling remorseful when the little girl starts crying, he seeks her out and the two
                            have a grand time playing games and pretending to be dragons and wizards. When the power
                            returns, Charlie is ready to retreat to his "handsets and bots" but decides that it might be
                            fun to spend some time with his sister as well. The hilarious cartoon illustrations are bold
                            and appealing and depict the siblings' many emotions with exaggerated clarity. While the
                            mother appears only as a hand patting her panicked son's head, the family dog is usually
                            present, patiently enduring a hose-down from little Isabel Jane or angrily reproving Charlie
                            for hurting her feelings. Pair this tale with Glenn McCoy's Penny Lee and Her TV (Hyperion,
                            2002) for a fun storytime during 'TV Turnoff Week.'"

                            "Charlie loves computer games so much, he never plays with anything else - so when the power
                            goes out, he's really in the dark. His desperate search for batteries involves his sister's
                            toys and some nasty behavior before he settles down to realize what's truly important in his
                            life. Deftly written by Suzanne Collins and nicely illustrated by Mike Lester, When Charlie
                            McButton Lost Power is refreshingly original and moving!"

                            "A computer-game addict temporarily turns into a raving lunatic when a power failure shuts
                            down his PC, and Lester is well up to the task of portraying his breakdown. He sends
                            red-haired Charlie, pop-eyed features wildly distorted with panic, dashing after an old
                            gameboy, then brutalizing his little sister Isabel Jane's talking doll for a triple-A
                            battery. When this behavior instantly relegates him to the Time-Out Chair, Charlie yells
                            (captured in the art by a gross-looking spray of red and yellow) at Isabel Jane, which sends
                            her away in tearsâ€”but then also causes him to reflect remorsefully on how much he actually
                            enjoys her company. Once off the chair, he seeks her out for a game of hide-and-seek.
                            Collins tells the tale in loosely written verse and leaves Charlie, as the house explodes
                            with restored light, thinking that he might go play with his sibling some more before
                            plugging in again. Unlikely to work as behavior modification, but young geeks may take a
                            break from their screens to enjoy the over-the-top art."
